# Capstone Project

This is my capstone project for the [Agents Intensive - Capstone Project](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/agents-intensive-capstone-project).

[5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course with Google Course Page](https://www.kaggle.com/learn-guide/5-day-agents)

## Description

This capstone project is an opportunity for you to apply what you've learned during the course week and submit it for evaluation.

- The high level process for a capstone project consists of:

    - Selecting a track:
        - Agents for Good 
            - Agents that tackle problems in education, healthcare, or 
            sustainability. 
    - Formulating a problem and solution pitch to which you will 
    build your agent. This will hone the objective of your project.
    - Developing and publishing the code for your agent publicly.
    - Being able to articulate the value of the agent by 
    preparing a writeup.
