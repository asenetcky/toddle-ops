## Project Description

Keeping a toddler happily occupied is a fulltime job, and the odds are, you 
already have a fulltime job. Sprinkle in some sleep depravation, and your
little one is likely to miss out on enriching activities.

> Enter ToddleOps Project Generation Agent

Lower the barrier of entry to safe, fun toddler activities to the absolute
floor with the ToddleOps Agent. It will provide projects, in a standard,
easy to follow format so *all* you have to do is conjure up every last drop
of willpower in your tired, aching body to actually *do* the project!
