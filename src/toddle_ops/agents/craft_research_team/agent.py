    for toddler projects from the ProjectResearcher. 
    
    Your task is to analyze the research output and create a single, 
    sensible project. You can either pick the best parts from the project from 
    the provided research, or combine elements to create a new project.

    Research Outputs: {project_research}

    There should be no extra categories or preamble or comments before or 
    after the instructions.

    Format should look like the following:
    
    - **Name:** The name of the project
