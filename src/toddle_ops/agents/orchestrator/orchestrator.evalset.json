This project encourages creativity and exploration of textures and colors.\n- **Duration:** 30 minutes\n- **Materials:**\n    * A few tablespoons of cornstarch\n    * Cold water\n    * 1 cup boiling water\n    * Liquid food coloring\n    * A few sheets of sturdy paper (like construction paper or cardstock)\n    * A shallow container or bowl\n    * A spoon for mixing\n- **Instructions:**\n    1.  **Make the Edible Paint:** In a medium saucepan, mix the cornstarch with about half a cup of cold water until smooth. Slowly add the boiling water and stir constantly until the mixture thickens. Remove from heat and let it cool. Once cooled, divide the mixture into smaller bowls, one for each color you want to make. Add a few drops of liquid food coloring to each bowl and stir well until you achieve your desired colors.\n    2.  **Prepare the Play Area:** Lay down some newspaper or a plastic tablecloth to protect your surface, as this can be a bit messy. Place a few sheets of paper in front of your toddler.\n    3.  **Paint Time:** Give your toddler a spoon and let them explore the edible paint. They can dip their fingers or the spoon into the paint and spread it onto the paper. You can also offer other safe tools like toy cars to roll through the paint or toy animals to make prints.\n    4.  **Explore and Taste:** Encourage your toddler to feel the texture of the paint and paper. Since the paint is edible, it's safe if they decide to taste it. This sensory experience helps develop their sense of touch and encourages creativity.\n    5.  **Clean Up:** Use baby wipes for easy cleanup of hands and any surfaces.\n\nWould you like to make another project or would you like to refine this one with more details?"

It's designed for shaking, rolling, and visual exploration.\n- **Duration:** 20 minutes\n- **Materials:**\n    * 1 clear plastic bottle with a secure lid (water bottle or soda bottle works well)\n    * Water\n    * Yellow food coloring\n    * Glitter (yellow or gold)\n    * Small yellow pom-poms or beads (ensure they are too large to be a choking hazard)\n    * Optional: A drop of clear glue or baby oil for a slower glitter effect\n- **Instructions:**\n    1. Ensure the plastic bottle is clean and dry.\n    2. Fill the bottle about halfway with water.\n    3. Add a few drops of yellow food coloring to the water and swirl gently until the desired shade of yellow is reached.\n    4. Add a generous amount of yellow or gold glitter to the bottle.\n    5. Add the small yellow pom-poms or beads.\n    6. If using, add a drop of clear glue or baby oil. This can help the glitter move more slowly and create a more mesmerizing effect.\n    7. Securely screw the lid onto the bottle. For extra security, you can glue the lid shut with a strong craft glue or hot glue (adult supervision required for glue application).\n    8. Give the bottle to your toddler to shake, roll, and explore the \"sunshine\" inside!\n\n- **Name:** Yellow Sensory Bin\n- **Description:** A sensory bin project for toddlers to explore the color yellow through various textures and objects.\n- **Duration:** 20 minutes\n- **Materials:**\n    * A shallow plastic bin or container\n    * Yellow-colored dry goods such as pasta (uncooked or cooked and cooled), rice, or popcorn kernels (ensure supervision to prevent choking)\n    * Yellow construction paper or cardstock cut into shapes (circles, squares)\n    * Yellow pom-poms\n    * Yellow-colored blocks or toys\n    * Scoops, small cups, or spoons for pouring and scooping\n- **Instructions:**\n    1. Prepare the Bin: Pour your chosen yellow-colored dry goods into the plastic bin. This will form the base of your sensory bin.\n    2. Add Yellow Elements: Scatter the yellow construction paper shapes, yellow pom-poms, and yellow blocks or toys into the bin.\n    3. Introduce Tools: Place the scoops, cups, and spoons alongside the bin, making them accessible for your toddler.\n    4. Supervise and Explore: Allow your toddler to freely explore the bin. Encourage them to scoop, pour, and discover the different yellow textures and items. Engage with them by asking questions about the colors and objects they are finding. Ensure constant supervision, especially if using small items like popcorn kernels or rice, to prevent choking hazards.\n\n- **Name:** Yellow Paper Plate Sun Craft\n- **Description:** A simple and cheerful craft project where toddlers can create their own smiling sun using a paper plate and yellow materials, encouraging fine motor skills and color recognition.\n- **Duration:** 15 minutes\n- **Materials:**\n    * Paper plates (1 per sun)\n    * Non-toxic yellow paint\n    * Paintbrush\n    * Yellow construction paper or yellow yarn\n    * Child-safe scissors (for adult use)\n    * Glue stick or liquid glue\n- **Instructions:**\n    1. Paint the Sun: Have your toddler paint the entire paper plate yellow. Let them explore the texture and color.\n    2. Prepare the Rays: While the paint dries, an adult can cut strips of yellow construction paper or pieces of yellow yarn to serve as sun rays.\n    3. Assemble the Sun: Once the paint is dry, help your toddler glue the yellow strips or yarn around the edge of the paper plate to create the sun's rays.\n    4. Add a Face (Optional): If you like, cut out a simple yellow circle for the sun's face and have your toddler glue it onto the center of the plate.\n\nWould you like to make another project or would you like to refine these ones with more details?"
